[^1]: This ID "kLiHb" doesn't mean to have some certain meaning when I came up with it. The meaning is up to your imagination.
You may think it as "k-Li-H-b" where "Li" is a Chinese family name and "H" stands for a first name.
Anyway I just wanted a username which may start with a "k" (or a uppercase one) and it should be looking cool to me.

[^2]: I used to refer to myself by 'henry_23', which probably origins from among some duaplicated IDs of "henry",
and maybe "henry_23" was the 23rd of them.
Fortunately, the number "23" both sounds and looks good to me, probably because it resembles the number "123".
