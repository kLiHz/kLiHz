[^1]: In mongolian, "tsagaan" stands for "white" and "bar" means "tiger". So "tsagaanbar" means "white tiger" in mongilian.

[^2]: I used to refer to myself by 'henry_23', which probably origins from among some duaplicated IDs of "henry",
and maybe "henry_23" was the 23rd of them.
Fortunately, the number "23" both sounds and looks good to me, probably because it resembles the number "123".
